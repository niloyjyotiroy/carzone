%Problem 15: Write a MATLAB program to record and save single and double channel audio.
%Record and save audio: Record Audio
%Source Code:
Fs=44100; %sampling frequency, default value is 8192
noc=1; %no of input channel
nob=16; %no of bits per sample, default value is 8bits per sample
recObj=audiorecorder(Fs, nob, noc);
%record(recObj)
%pause(5); % no ofseconds
recordblocking(recObj, 5); %start recording for 5 seconds
play(recObj); %play back the recording
myRecording=getaudiodata(recObj); %getting recorded audio data as an array
plot(myRecording);
audiowrite('songarbanglacircus.wav', myRecording, Fs);
